## [0.5.4 / 5.46.0] - 2021-01-06

### Added
- Sandboxie now strips particularly problematic privileges from sandboxed system tokens
-- with those a process could attempt to bypass the sandbox isolation (thanks Diversenok)
-- old legacy behaviour can be enabled with "StripSystemPrivileges=n" (absolutely NOT Recommended) 
- added new isolation options "ClosePrintSpooler=y" and "OpenSmartCard=n" 
-- those resources are open by default but for a hardened box it’s desired to close them
- added print spooler filter to prevent printers from being set up outside the sandbox
-- the filter can be disabled with "OpenPrintSpooler=y"
- added overwrite prompt when recovering an already existing file
- added "StartProgram=", "StartService=" and "AutoExec=" options to the SandMan UI
- added more compatibility templates (thanks isaak654)

### Changed
- Changed Emulated SCM behaviour, boxed services are no longer by default started as boxed system
-- use "RunServicesAsSystem=y" to enable the old legacy behaviour
-- Note: sandboxed services with a system token are still sandboxed and restricted 
-- However not granting them a system token in the first place removes possible exploit vectors
-- Note: this option is not compatible with "ProtectRpcSs=y" and takes precedence!
- Reworked dynamic IPC port handling
- Improved Resource Monitor status strings

### Fixed

- fixed issues with dynamic IPC port handling that allowed to bypass IPC isolation
- fixed issue with IPC tracing
- fixed CVE-2019-13502 "\RPC Control\LSARPC_ENDPOINT" is now filtered by the driver (thanks Diversenok)
-- this allowed some system options to be changed, to disable filtering use "OpenLsaEndpoint=y"
